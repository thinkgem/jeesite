modify, and distribute a Software Release in a collective work assembled
with the Product.

You should carefully read the following terms and conditions before using,
installing, copying, or distributing the Software. Unless otherwise agreed in
writing by CKSource, your use, installation, copying, or distribution of
CKFinder indicates your acceptance of this License.

3. Scope of License

All rights of any kind to CKFinder which are not expressly granted in this
Agreement are entirely and exclusively reserved to and by CKSource. CKFinder is
protected by applicable national and international laws and treaties.

You may use, install, copy, and distribute CKFinder solely as expressly provided
in this Agreement. You may not rent, lease, loan, sublicense, reverse engineer,
decompile, disassemble, or create derivative works based on the Software, in
whole or in part, nor permit anyone else to do so.

It is agreed that in exchange for the license set forth herein, you will pay a
license fee ("License Fee"). The fee value will be specified by CKSource at the
moment of the purchase.

4. License Models

CKFinder may be assembled with the Product and redistributed in respect of one
and only one of the following models ("License Models") of Your choice:

a) ("Website") Assembling the Software into a Product distributed as a single
jeesite ("Site"). The Site URL ("URL") must be specified at the moment of the
purchase. The license will not be valid for sub-domains of the specified URL.
This license includes 5 Developer licenses that cover Development Activities
exclusively related to the Site.

b) ("Corporate Websites") Assembling the Software with any number of Sites owned
or produced by You. Sites produced by third parties with Software produced by

Non Development Activities on Production Websites do not require Developer
licenses.

License Fees values may differ depending on the license model.

5. Unlicensed Copies

If you did not pay for a license, you may use unlicensed copies of CKFinder
for the exclusive purpose of demonstration. In this case you will be using
CKFinder in the "demo mode". Without derogating from the forgoing, you may not
use CKFinder in the "demo mode" for commercial purposes. CKFinder shall only be
used for evaluation purposes and may not be used or disclosed for any other
purposes, including without limitation, or for external distribution.
You may not remove demo notices from the interface nor disable the ability to
display such notices or otherwise modify CKFinder. Product support, if any,
is not offered for CKFinder in the "demo mode".

6. Agreement Acceptance

This Agreement is automatically accepted by both parties as long as You are
in possession of legal evidence ("Legal Evidence") that the acceptance has
taken place. The Legal Evidence can be represented by (i) an agreement signed
by You and CKSource stating the acceptance of this Agreement or (ii) a valid
purchase invoice, or fully paid order confirmation, provided by CKSource and
addressed to You. The Legal Evidence must precisely indicate this Agreement Name,
the Software Name, the License Model You have chosen, and the following
restrictive information, if applicable:

a) If You have chosen the Website License Model, the Site Hostname must be
indicated in the Legal Evidence. This Agreement will be valid for the Software
assembled with the Site publicized under the Site Hostname only. Other Sites
are excluded from this Agreement as long as a Legal Evidence is not produced
for each of these Sites.

b) If You have chosen the OEM License Model, the unique and well recognizable
name of Your Product ("Product Name") must be indicated in the Legal Evidence.
This Agreement will be valid for the Software assembled with the Product
recognizable by the Product Name at the moment of the purchase. This Agreement
does not lose its validity in the case the Product is renamed after the Legal
Evidence production.

Legal Evidences may define further rights and limitation terms that are not
described in this Agreement. Any term present in the Agreement that goes in
conflict with the Legal Evidence terms is to be deleted or amended.

Legal Evidences for different combinations of License Models, Sites, and
Products will not restrict each other and will not interfere in the rights
granted to You by each of them.

Legal Evidences for the Website or OEM License Models are not transferable
to different Sites or Products.

7. Limitation on Releases

This agreement is valid for all Releases of the Software that have the Release
Date happening before the day calculated by adding 365 days to the date the
Legal Evidence has been made effective. CKSource has no obligation to provide
you any Release that is not released for general distribution to other
CKSource's licensees. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to obligate
CKSource to provide additional Releases to You under any circumstances.

8. Support

CKSource shall provide support for Developer Persons covered by valid Developer
licenses for the period of 365 days following the day the Legal Evidence has
been made effective. Support shall be limited to electronic messaging access.

CKSource shall keep You informed, either per CKSource readiness or by following
your request, including changes to it, about the rules and procedures that You
must perform to enjoy support under the terms of this Agreement. Electronic
messaging access shall be limited to Development Activities regarding problem
solving, bug reporting, documentation clarification, and technical guidance
(each a "Support Request"). CKSource is not in any way obliged to perform bug
fixing or custom development activities as a result of a Support Request.

9. License Key

Following a valid License purchase, a unique license key (the "License Key")
may be provided to You, which allows for the activation of the Software.
The License Key is subject to the restrictions set forth in this License and
may not be disclosed or distributed in any way. The disclosure or distribution
of the License Key shall constitute a breach of this License, the effect of
which shall be the automatic termination and revocation of any and all the
rights granted herein.

A single License Key may be issued for Licenses under the Developer License
Model, which shall be installed on Development Servers only and will be valid
for the number of Developers specified during the license purchase. Further
License Keys for the Developer License Model may be issued to you, which will
enlarge the allowed number of Developers performing Development Activities on
Development Servers that already have the Software installed and activated by
any of the Developer Licenses You have purchased before.

10. Source Code

The original source code ("Source Code") of CKFinder may be distributed by
CKSource alongside with the executable version of it, or as integral part of it.
You may modify and compile the Source Code. The Source Code or its modified
version can be copied and distributed exclusively in respect to the scope of
this license, as defined in the "License Model" terms of this license, as long
as a valid license has been purchased for the distribution target. CKSource
retains all rights over the Source Code and all parts of it present in modified
versions of it. Redistributions of the Source Code and modified versions of it
must contain the original headers and copyright notices. Modifications to the
Source Code must be explicitly and entirely identified in the Source Code files.
This section of the license supersedes all modification restrictions imposed by
other sections of it. You are not allowed to remove copyright notices nor make
changes to license validation code present in the Source Code.

rights in the Software. The Software is licensed, not sold. This Agreement does

if you fail to comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. You may
terminate this Agreement at any time without cause. In case of termination,
in any circumstance, payments issued by You will not be reimbursed.

the authority to grant the license hereunder. To the best of CKSource's
knowledge the Software does not infringe upon the intellectual property rights
of any third party and that CKSource did not receive any notice regarding any
alleged infringement thereof.

14. Disclaimer of Warranties

With the exclusion of warranties explicitly mentioned in Section 12, the

OF SUCH DAMAGES.
