		as <em>collaborative software</em> that makes it easy to maintain and share files
		located on a central computer (the <em>server</em>).</p>

		Whether you are new to CKFinder or an experienced user, it is well worth spending
		some time browsing through the CKFinder documentation in order to gain full
